# hello-world
This is essentially my first repository.

I'm Greg, a self-taught graphic designer, web designer, and lover of tech and gear.

I have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics from a Historically Black College, and a graduate degree in non-profit management.

I'm currently working on my second masters degree, in Web Development and Design.
